Oct 2017 Release
Added scw parameter for supercube
Added 6x6 cube
Removed links to irbsystems.com which is going down Nov 18

August 2017 Release
Modified so that mouse works when scrolling across other cubes (while rotating).
To make this work with Firefox there are also mods in the cube.html file. 

A minor modification to Supercube is that when specifying the colorscheme or
facelets parameter the W is no longer automatically translated to black (so
use K for black).  This allows W to be used to specify blank facelets.
